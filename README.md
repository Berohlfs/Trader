## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project was created for **educational and experimental purposes only**. Trading cryptocurrencies involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results. 
The bot is no longer in operation. Despite the script's automated behavior, it was sometimes necessary to manually execute sell orders when predefined take-profit or stop-loss conditions were not triggered, 
in order to minimize unnecessary, rapid, and uncontrolled losses ‚Äî which still occurred with some frequency due to market volatility.
